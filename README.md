Introduction for IFCYA members to using GIT


Here are the steps:

1. Make a new Branch (You can do this by typing git checkout -b YOURBRANCHNAME)
2. Add new content to the readme file and make a new file called Other.md  
3. Commit your changes to the branch (This can be done by entering 
```
git add .
git commit -m "A COMMIT MESSAGE OF YOUR CHOICE"
git push
```
)
3. Make a pull request to the main repository
(This is done on the github website. Feel free to look at their documentation)
